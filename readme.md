This is a CLI readme.md generator for projects. It was made with node.js using the inquirer package.

Requires nodejs and inquirer. Extract or clone the repo using

    git clone git@github.com:stanjosh/md-gen.git

 From the newly created directory, run npm install to install dependencies (inquirer). You can install md-gen globally with

    npm install -g .



## Usage

Run 

    md-gen 
    
if it's installed globally, or 

    node .
    
from within its folder. It will walk you through the rest of the steps to create a readme file an the file will be printed to the console. md-gen will ask you if you'd like to save the readme file. If you choose to save it, it will be saved as `readme.md` in the current directory.
